    <title>Guide history</title>

    <para>This guide was born as a collection of sparse notes that
      Federico Lupi, the original author of the NetBSD Guide, wrote
      mostly for himself.  When he realized that they could be useful
      to other &os; users he started collecting them and created the
      first version of the guide using the
      <application>groff</application> formatter.  In order to
      <quote>easily</quote> get a wider variety of output formats
      (e.g. HTML and PostScript/PDF), he made the
      <quote>mistake</quote> of moving to SGML/DocBook, which is the
      current format of the sources.  Maintainership was picked up by
      the NetBSD project and its developers later, and the format was
      changed to XML/DocBook later due to better tools and slightly
      more knowhow on customisations. </para>

    <para>The following open source tools were used to write and format
      the guide:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>the <application>vi</application> editor which ships with
	  &os; (nvi).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>the <application>libxslt</application> parser from GNOME for
	  transforming XML/DocBook into HTML.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>the <application>TeX</application> system from the &os;
	  packages collection.
	  TeX is used as a backend to produce the PS and PDF
	  formats.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>the <application>tgif</application> program for drawing
	  the figures.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>the <application>gimp</application> and
	  <application>xv</application> programs for converting
	  between image formats and making small modifications to
	  the figures.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Many thanks to all the people involved in the development of
      these great tools.</para>
